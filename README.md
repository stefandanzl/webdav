# Webdav

## Reliable and quick way to keep your vault in sync on all your devices

This plugin makes use of comparing file checksums between Obsidian vault and a WebDav and file server.
Only a few WebDav Servers support checksum metadata.
Furthermore, it is required to set CORS Allow Origin Header to "*", which may not be possible on many systems.
